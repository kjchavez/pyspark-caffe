# PySpark-Caffe
Allows for seamless integration between Caffe and Spark via their respective Python bindings.

## Setup
We assume you already have Spark installed and running, either locally or on a cluster. These setup instructions will help you with configurations so that it will be able to access Caffe.

### Running Locally
- Install Caffe in some well known location, which we'll refer to as CAFFE\_PATH.
